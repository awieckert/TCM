# Treehouse Cage Match

# Description
This exercise taught us how to compare data from two different JSON files using mulitple XHR requests. Users with treehouse accounts can challenge each other in a battle of POINTS! Or PTZs as we  like to call them.

Upon button click the JSON files of each challenger are requested and then compared. The player with the most PTZs has their name and badges of honor triumpantly displayed on the webpage for all to see!
